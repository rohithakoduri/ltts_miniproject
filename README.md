About rock paper scissor game: Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").


## Research
--- A **All-in-one gaming portal** is a platform for various games where u can access different types of games in single application.

Portal consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects.

This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game.

Games who have recently switched to open source integrated systems have discovered that providers are now more likely to offer reliable support in order to maintain better platform for various games.

- Snake game
This is a clone of the classic game snake that was implemented in old mobile phones.
The aim of the game is to collect the gold ($), avoid cactuses (*) and borders, including colliding with the tail of the snake itself. As you collect gold, the snake gets longer, thus increasing the likelihood of crashing into yourself. When all gold has been collected you are hauled to the next level without any warning. For each new level the snake gets longer and the amount of gold and cactuses increases.
You get scored according to the length of the snake and the number of cactuses on the screen. The speed increases every 5 levels. You get a bonus of 1000 points when you complete each level.

Note: There is no concept of lives. Once you hit an obstacle, that's it, game over.

- Tic Tac Toe

After that, the two players take turns placing an O or X alternately into an empty cell of the board corresponding to the cell of the previous move. (For example, if the previous move was into the upper right corner of a board, the next move must be made into the upper right board.)

The game is won by getting three-in-a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally in one of the boards. If a player is unable to make their move (because the relevant board is already full) the game ends in a draw.
